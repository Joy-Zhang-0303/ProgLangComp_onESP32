# C/C++ project for performance evaluation on ESP32
# Prerequisites
This project was created and can be opened and flashed by [Platform IO](https://platformio.org/). 
Arduino framework for [M5 Stack Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/espressif32/m5stack-core-esp32.html?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=piohome) was used. 
After opening the project with Platform IO, it should install any necessary extensions and plugins (if they're not installed yet).
The `upload_port` parameter in `platformio.ini` file should be changed to correct COM(or /dev/ttyUSB) port of ESP32 on your PC.

# Building and flashing
Use Platform IO `Build` button to build or `Upload` to build and flash the code.
